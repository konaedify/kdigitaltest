# KDigital — Website

A modern, multi-page marketing site for **KDigital Technologies**, built as self-contained HTML pages. It runs as plain static files — no build step, no framework install — so it deploys anywhere that serves static files (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, S3, any web server).

> **Note:** Pages use the `.dc.html` extension. They are ordinary HTML files — they open directly in any browser. `Nav.dc.html` and `Footer.dc.html` are shared components the other pages pull in; keep them alongside the rest.

You can safely delete `screenshots/` and `_archive/` before deploying — they aren't used by the site.

## Run locally

Because pages load a few sibling files, use a tiny static server rather than opening the file directly:

```bash
# Python (already on most machines)
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/Home.dc.html
```

```bash
# or Node
npx serve .
```

---

## Put it on GitHub

1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/) and create a free account at [github.com](https://github.com).
2. In this folder, initialize and commit:

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: KDigital website"
   ```

3. Create a new **empty** repository on GitHub (no README/license) — e.g. `kdigital-website`.
4. Connect and push (replace `YOUR-USERNAME`):

   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/kdigital-website.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

Your code is now on GitHub.

## Deploy on Vercel

### Option A — Import from GitHub (recommended)

1. Sign in at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) with your GitHub account.
2. Click **Add New… → Project**, then **Import** your `kdigital-website` repo.
3. Framework Preset: **Other**. Leave **Build Command** empty and **Output Directory** as `./` (root). There is no build step — it's static.
4. Click **Deploy**. In ~30 seconds you'll get a live URL like `kdigital-website.vercel.app`.

`vercel.json` is picked up automatically and gives you clean URLs (`/platform`, `/products/kona-crm`, `/solutions/education`, …) plus long-lived caching for assets.

### Option B — Vercel CLI

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel        # preview deploy (follow the prompts)
vercel --prod # production deploy
```

### Add your custom domain (kdigital.ai)

1. In the Vercel project → **Settings → Domains**, add `kdigital.ai` and `www.kdigital.ai`.
2. At your domain registrar, point DNS to Vercel (an `A` record for the apex and a `CNAME` for `www`, as Vercel instructs).
3. Vercel provisions HTTPS automatically.

> Every push to your GitHub `main` branch will auto-deploy to production. Pull requests get their own preview URLs.

---

## Before you go live (from SEO-Report.md)

- Confirm the production domain is `https://www.kdigital.ai` — if it changes, update the URLs in `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and the `canonical`/`og:url` tags.
- Verify the site in **Google Search Console** + **Bing Webmaster Tools** and submit `sitemap.xml`.
- Add **GA4** (or a privacy-first analytics tag) — paste the snippet into each page's `<helmet>`.
- Set `<html lang="en">` if you later move to a server-rendered setup.

See **SEO-Report.md** for the full audit, URL map, and keyword targets.

## Editing content

Each page is a single `.dc.html` file. Text and styling live inline; the page's data (cards, stats, menu items) lives in the `<script data-dc-script>` block at the bottom of the file. Edit, save, refresh — no build required. Shared header/footer changes go in `Nav.dc.html` / `Footer.dc.html` and apply everywhere.
